## Setup

### Quick run

Python (>=3.8) is required for this installation type, please install it before continuing.

```bash
# Install the package
$ pip install waka-relay

# Then run the app
$ waka-relay
```

### Uv

Using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager (this method does not require a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) on non Windows systems) and is usually the preferred option:

```bash
# Install the tool (system wide command)
$ uv tool install waka-relay

# Run it
$ waka-relay

# Run it (without installing the command)
$ uv tool run waka-relay
```

### Python

Python (>=3.8) is required for this installation type, please install it before continuing.

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ImShyMike/waka-relay.git

# Move into the project's folder
$ cd waka-relay

# Install the dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then run the app using python 
$ python wakarelay/main.py

# Or use uvicorn directly (WARNING: this will ignore the host, port, and worker configuration)
$ uvicorn wakarelay.main:app
```

### Using docker

Using the prebuilt image:

```bash
# Pull the docker image
$ docker pull shymike/waka-relay

# Then run the container
$ docker run -d \
  -p 25892:25892 \
  -v ~/.waka-relay.toml:/root/.waka-relay.toml \
  --name waka-relay \
  waka-relay
```

Or build the image yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ImShyMike/waka-relay.git

# Move into the project's folder
$ cd waka-relay

# First start by building the docker image
$ docker build --network host -t waka-relay .

# Then run the container
$ docker run -d \
  -p 25892:25892 \
  -v ~/.waka-relay.toml:/root/.waka-relay.toml \
  --name waka-relay \
  waka-relay
```

## Usage

In your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file, set the API url to the adress of the `waka-relay` server. (this example uses localhost)

```cfg
[settings]
api_key = 39949664-5a5f-4c7d-95b2-44a864f67b6a
api_url = http://localhost:25892
```

(`api_key` must be a valid UUID, even if `require_api_key` is `false`)

## How it works

![waka-relay graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImShyMike/waka-relay/refs/heads/main/assets/graph.png)

A "WakaTime instance" does not need to be the real WakaTime server, it can also be anything that implements the same protocol. ([compatible backends](#known-compatible-backends))

## Example config

The configuration file must be located either in `~/.waka-relay.toml` or `./.waka-relay.toml` (first config file found is used)

```toml
[relay]
workers = 2
timeout = 10
require_api_key = true
api_key = "39949664-5a5f-4c7d-95b2-44a864f67b6a"
debug = false

[relay.instances]
"https://api.wakatime.com/api/v1" = "WAKATIME API KEY"
```

For a full config example with an explanation check out the [example config file](.waka-relay.toml).

## Configuration options

| TOML key | Default value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
|`host`|`"0.0.0.0"`|Host for the webserver to listen on|
|`port`|`25892`|Port for the webserver to run on|
|`workers`|`1`|Worker process count for the webserver|
|`timeout`|`25`|Timeout value for the relayed requests (in seconds)|
|`retries`|`3`|Number of retries for failed requests|
|`time_text`|`"%TEXT% (Relayed)"`|Text to display in the IDE (%TEXT% is replaced by what the api retuns)|
|`require_api_key`|`false`|Whether or not to require an API key|
|`api_key`|`""`|The API key to use if `require_api_key` is true|
|`project_api_keys`|`{}`|Optional project-specific API keys (see example below)|
|`debug`|`false`|Whether or not to enable debug logging|

### Project-specific API keys

You can configure different API keys for different projects by adding a `project_api_keys` section:

```toml
[relay.project_api_keys]
"my-secret-project" = "project-specific-api-key-123"
"work-project" = "work-api-key-456"
```

This allows different projects to authenticate with their own unique API keys, while still supporting the global `api_key` as a fallback.

## Known compatible backends

This relay is know to be compatible with the following backend servers:

* [WakaTime](https://github.com/wakatime)
* [Wakapi](https://github.com/muety/wakapi)
* [Hackatime](https://github.com/hackclub/hackatime)
* [Hackatime (old)](https://github.com/hackclub/archived-hacktime)
* [OtterTime](https://github.com/SkyfallWasTaken/ottertime)

<sub>(all of the above servers were tested using the vscode extension)</sub>

Others may work, this is just a list of the ones that were tested and are compatible.

## Issues

Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ImShyMike/waka-relay/issues/new) on the github if you come across a bug or crash as this project has not been fully tested and may have some bugs.
